1. Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life! Here is her hand, the agent of her heart; Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn. O, that our fathers would applaud our loves, To seal our happiness with their consents! O heavenly Julia!

2. Why good fellow, What shall I do to win my lord again? Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven, I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's displeasure.
